<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I'm a Musician and a Teacher who is working towards becoming a web developer in the future</p>

<p>At the moment I just finished all my html introductory modules and it took me about 5 to 6 hours to get to this point.</p>

<p>I will now move forward to start learning CSS as during my next few units of this course.</p>
